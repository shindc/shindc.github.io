1. Ultra-stable terahertz-frequency synthesizer

<div id="a">
Stable terahertz-frequency sources are essential to advance high-precision terahertz applications, for example, molecular spectroscopy, terahertz radars, and 6G wireless communications.
We propose an optical frequency comb-based scheme that permits terahertz-frequency synthesis with direct stabilization to an ultrastable high-finesse optical cavity. 
We verified that terahertz-frequencies across 0.10 â€“ 1.10 THz can achieve 10<sup>-15</sup> levels of the fractional frequency instability at 1 s averaging time. 
By photo-mixing two optical frequencies precisely selected via optical injection locking, we demonstrated an arbitrary frequency control in a programmable manner with a 15-digit precision over a 2-GHz span.
The results were presented in multiple first-author and co-authored conference papers (journal papers in preparation).
