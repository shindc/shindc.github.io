      1. Ultra-stable terahertz-frequency synthesizer

    <br>
      Stable terahertz-frequency sources are essential to advance high-precision terahertz applications, for example, molecular spectroscopy, terahertz radars, and 6G wireless communications.
      We propose an optical frequency comb-based scheme that permits terahertz-frequency synthesis with direct stabilization to an ultrastable high-finesse optical cavity. 
      We verified that terahertz-frequencies across 0.10 – 1.10 THz can achieve 10<sup>-15</sup> levels of the fractional frequency instability at 1 s averaging time. 
      By photo-mixing two optical frequencies precisely selected via optical injection locking, we demonstrated an arbitrary frequency control in a programmable manner with a 15-digit precision over a 2-GHz span.
      The results were presented in multiple first-author and co-authored conference papers (journal papers in preparation).

      2. Step emulsification device operated by centrifugation
      </b>
      </font>
      <br>
      Monodisperse picoliter droplets have been widely used for biochemical reactors and preparation of functional microbeads for food, cosmetics, and medical industry. 
      Although conventional microfluidic technologies enable the production of monodisperse picoliter droplets, special instruments (e.g. syringe pump) are required, leading to its poor usability and accessibility in other research fields.
      We propose centrifuge-based step emulsification device housed in a microtube for simple and fast generation of monodisperse picoliter droplets. 
      Our device consists of a reservoir part for the storage of dispersed phase and a microchannel part for droplet formation. 
      Centrifugation using a commercial centrifuge exerts excessive pressure on the dispersed phase, infusing it into a microchannel. 
      The infused dispersed phase is pinched off, forming droplets due to the channel geometry for step emulsification. 
      The produced droplets at the step then are transported to the bottom of the microtube due to the centrifugal force.

      We achieved formation of monodisperse water-in-oil (W/O) picoliter droplets with diameters ranging from 18 to 90 μm. 
      Moreover, we demonstrated the cell-free protein synthesis reaction in monodisperse picoliter droplets as well as the production of cell-sized glucose-responsive hydrogel microbeads. 
      We believe that our device would be a powerful tool for simple and fast pre-paration of picoliter samples with high usability.
      The results were published in a first-author conference paper and journal paper.
