## About Me
------
* I am currently a researcher, an alternative form of military duty, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Seung-Woo Kim](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=wHt0GtQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Young-Jin Kim](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=DqkYhz4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).<br>

* Previously, I graduated with the highest honors from [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) in 2016, and then received M.S. degree from [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) in 2018.<br>

* With strong backgrounds in microfluidics, ultrafast photonics, nanophotonics, and precise electrical measurements, I pursue trans-disciplinary research for creating novel technologies that enable solving high-impact challenges and advances for human knowledge and understanding.

* My current research interests include
  * Ultrafast photonics based on optical frequency comb
  * Ultra-stable optical/terahertz-frequency synthesizer
  * Nanophotonics
  * Microfluidics
  * Machine learning
