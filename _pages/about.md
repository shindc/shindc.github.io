# About Me
* I am a researcher, an alternative form of militery duty, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Seung-Woo Kim](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=wHt0GtQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Young-Jin Kim](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=DqkYhz4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).  <br>
* I pursue trans-disciplinary research to create novel technologies that enable solving high-impact challenges and advances of human knowledge and understanding with strong backgrounds in microfluidics, ultrafast photonics, nanophotonics, and precise electrical measurements.<br>

* My current research interests include
  * Ultrafast photonics based on optical frequency comb
  * Ultra-stable optical/terahertz-frequency synthesizer
  * Nanophotonics
  * Microfluidics
  * Machine learning
